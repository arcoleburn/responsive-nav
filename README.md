## Responsive Nav 

Generates views for nested nav on mobile, displays horizontal nav bar on desktop. 

Content of nav can be edited by changing the menuData.js file, making this reusable. 

Currently, all final links in nav (ie: no nested children) redirect to main page by default. Routes can easily be coded when pages are built.
